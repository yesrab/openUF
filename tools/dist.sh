# openUF release packaging
#
# Builds openuf.tar.gz from a comment-stripped copy of the tree. OpenWrt
# devices are flash-constrained and roughly half of openuf/'s bytes are
# comments, so the repo keeps its protocol-archaeology commentary and the
# device does not.
#
# Usage:
#   sh tools/dist.sh            — build openuf.tar.gz
#   sh tools/dist.sh --verify   — build, then prove the stripped tree is
#                                 bytecode-identical and still passes the suite
