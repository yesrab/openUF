#
# This is not part of openUF -- the real `iw` binary is still installed
# (see the Dockerfile) and this script falls through to it for anything
# it doesn't specifically handle. It only intercepts `survey dump`,
# `station dump`, `scan dump`, `dev <ifname> info`, and `phy phyN info`
# against the synthetic wlan0/wlan1 netdevs ubus-mock.sh invents (this
# container has no real wireless hardware for the real `iw` to
# introspect, so those commands would otherwise always fail).
# Field names deliberately match the real iw(8) binary's own format
# strings (confirmed via `strings /usr/sbin/iw`) -- see the accompanying
# openuf/sysinfo.lua fix, which found the *parser* previously expected
# names iw never actually prints.
