# Protocol validation findings

openUF's assumptions about the UniFi inform protocol were originally inferred from
third-party reference material — [amd989/unifi-gateway](https://github.com/amd989/unifi-gateway)
and [paultyng/go-unifi](https://github.com/paultyng/go-unifi) — never checked against a
real UniFi Network Application. This document is the project's own ground truth,
established by running openUF against a real self-hosted controller, capturing decrypted
inform responses (`debug_dump_file`, see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md#3-configuration)), and
decompiling the controller's own Java bytecode and React bundles.

**Where this document and the third-party references disagree, this document wins.**
In particular, go-unifi models the controller's *admin REST API*, which is a different
surface from the inform wire protocol — several fields that exist there
(`bandsteering_mode`, `dtim_mode`, `roamingAssistant*`) have no counterpart on the wire.

This is a **reference for the confirmed current state**, not a lab journal. Superseded
hypotheses and the investigation trails that produced these facts have been removed;
git history has them if needed. Decompiled evidence is retained inline wherever a claim
would otherwise be hard to re-verify.

**Environment:** `lscr.io/linuxserver/unifi-network-application:10.4.57` (Docker, pinned),
with openUF running as the AP in a disposable Alpine container on the same Docker network
(`tools/validation/`).

**Status:** adoption, provisioning, and every UI-surfaced feature listed in the
[feature matrix](#feature-matrix) are confirmed working end-to-end against a real
controller, except where a row says otherwise.

---

## Validation environment

Everything in this section is about `tools/validation/`, not about openUF's product code.
Real OpenWrt target hardware has genuine `uci`/`iw`/`ubus`/`hostapd` and hits none of it.

### Required setup, in order

1. **`lua-openssl` must be present in the AP container.** Without an AES-GCM backend the
   controller will never provision the device — see
   [the GCM provisioning gate](#the-gcm-provisioning-gate). `tools/validation/ap/Dockerfile`
   builds the `zhaozg/lua-openssl` rock (`luarocks-5.1 install openssl`); no prebuilt Alpine
   apk exists. `install.sh` already installs `lua-openssl` on real OpenWrt hardware.
2. **Set the Inform Host Override before adopting anything.** Devices → Device Updates and
   Settings → Device SSH Settings. It must be the controller container's **literal IP** —
   the controller rejects a bare hostname with `ERROR inform - dev[<mac>] invalid inform_ip
   <hostname>`. This setting lives in the controller's own DB and is wiped by every
   `docker compose down -v`.
3. **Set a Device SSH Authentication password** (≥12 characters, enforced by the controller's
   own validator). Needed for L2/SSH adoption.

Skipping (2) presents as adoption silently stalling: `state.json` never flips
`adopted: true`, and `server.log` logs `inform decryption failed with defaultAuthKey=false`
— the controller *did* issue a per-device key, but the device never received a usable
config push. That is a setup omission, not a new bug.

### Always reset fully; never patch live state

Validation runs start from `docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d --build`.
Hand-editing a running container's `state.json`, or a device doc in Mongo, produces
results that do not reproduce — see [the minidev cache](#the-minidev-cache-never-sees-external-writes).

### The mocks, and their one sharp edge

The Alpine container has no `uci`, `ubus`, `iw`, `bridge`, or `hostapd`. Four
validation-only shims stand in, all outside `openuf/`:

| Shim | Stands in for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ap/uci-mock.lua` | `require("uci")` | Installed at `/usr/local/share/lua/5.1/uci.lua`. Seeded with `radio0`/`radio1` `wifi-device` sections matching `generic-dualband-ap.lua`'s `hwassign`. |
| `ap/ubus-mock.sh` | `ubus call network.wireless status` | Static `radio0`→`wlan0`, `radio1`→`wlan1` map. |
| `ap/iw-mock.sh` | `iw dev … survey/station/scan dump` | Three fake stations with independently growing counters, plus fake neighbour BSSes. |
| `ap/bridge-mock.sh` | `bridge fdb show` | Two fake wired hosts; `entrypoint.sh` seeds `/proc/net/arp` via `ip neigh replace` (kernel state can't be baked into an image layer). |

**`uci-mock.lua` is in-memory only, per process.** Its `db` table is seeded fresh at
process start and only ever one-way dumped to a debug JSON file on `commit()` — never read
back. Consequences:

- Restarting `inform.lua` to pick up code changes **wipes any WiFi network config that was
  only ever pushed to the previous process's memory.** Recreate the WLAN in the controller
  UI afterwards to force a fresh `system_cfg` push.
- A throwaway `lua5.1 script.lua` invocation gets its own pristine mock state and proves
  nothing about the running daemon. **The only reliable way to check live wire data is to
  read what the controller actually received** (Mongo, or the REST API), never a fresh
  local script.

### Other environment facts

- **`cap_add: [NET_ADMIN]`** is required on the `ap` service — `netconfig.lua`'s `ip addr
  add`/`ip route replace` and `firewall.lua`'s `nft` both fail with `Operation not
  permitted` without it. Docker drops the capability by default even for root.
- **A `docker stop`/`start` of an AP container yields a fresh MAC from Docker**, so a
  restarted container is a brand-new device to the controller. Convenient for producing
  fresh adoption targets; means a stopped device's controller entry can never be resumed.
- **`ap2` compose service** (`replacement` profile) provides a second same-model device for
  the replace/clone flows; recipes in `tools/validation/README.md` §6.
- A `reboot` handled inside the container genuinely exits the container (no init to survive
  it). `docker start` the stopped — not removed — container to recover logs.
- Background `127.0.0.1:9080/api/ucore/manifest` and `get-ulp-manifest` connection-refused
  errors appear in `server.log` regardless of device activity. Pre-existing and harmless.

---

## Controller behaviors that are not openUF bugs

Each of these cost real investigation time at least once.

### A 404 with an empty body does not mean the inform was rejected

A well-formed, correctly-encrypted first-contact inform gets **HTTP 404 with
`Content-Length: 0`**, with zero corresponding entry in the controller's `inform` logger —
yet the device is created server-side and shows as "1 device is ready to adopt." Verified at
the wire level through a raw byte-logging TCP relay: the `100 Continue` handshake completes
normally and the response genuinely has an empty body.

Malformed packets behave differently and are easy to tell apart: they get **400** with a
specific logged reason (`Bad packet magic`, `Data version 0 is not supported`,
`Content too short`).

Ruled out as causes, so they aren't re-tried: compression (a real zlib-compressed,
correctly-flagged payload gets the same 404) and GCM-vs-CBC (both get the same 404).

`http_post` treats any non-200 as a hard failure and never inspects the body. In every case
observed the body was genuinely empty, so nothing is lost — but the client cannot
distinguish "processed, nothing to say" from "rejected," and backs off identically either way.

**When you see this on a fresh device: click Adopt.** That is the correct next move, not
more debugging.

### Historical stats live in the `unifi_stat` database, on a 5-minute cadence

CPU/memory graphs, per-client Traffic Activity, the Radios tab's "Avg." columns, and the
Ports view's Bps chart are **not** rendered from live inform data. They are read from
`unifi_stat`'s `stat_5minutes` / `stat_hourly` / `stat_archive` collections, written by a
periodic archiver (`com.ubnt.service.system.QDcGUYAmLvJwylXw`, internally labelled
`stat-processor`).

So: a flat/empty graph checked two minutes after adoption is expected. Allow ~15 minutes, or
a few 5-minute buckets, before treating it as a defect. Query
`unifi_stat.stat_5minutes` directly to check whether the data is landing — `db.stat` in the
**`unifi`** database is a different, empty collection and querying it is misleading.

### The minidev cache never sees external writes

`com.ubnt.service.devmgr.SNMiFVJXxaonBOtqbJ`'s device lookup is cache-then-DB-fallback: an
in-memory "minidev" summary (`_id`, `site_id`, `authkeys`, `x_aes_gcm`, `hash_id`) keyed
`("global", "minidev", mac)`, populated once on the first DB hit and never invalidated by an
external write. Editing a device doc in Mongo while the controller runs therefore has no
observable effect. Restarting the controller to force a reload introduces its own artifact:
the device flips to **Offline** in the UI even while `last_seen` keeps advancing and informs
keep landing, and does not self-heal within a normal observation window.

This is why the "always reset fully" rule exists. It also explains why "Remove"
(factory-reset) leaves informs decrypting successfully afterwards — they are being served
from a stale cache entry while the underlying doc is already gone.

### Config sync can get stuck after informs stabilise

Observed while trying to force pure-WPA3 emission: switching the test WLAN's Security
Protocol to WPA3 made the controller **stop pushing the WLAN's `aaa.<n>`/`wireless.<n>`
blocks entirely** — not just the SAE fields — and reverting the setting did not restore
pushes, even across an `inform.lua` restart. No related error in `server.log`.

**Reusable warning:** a live no-op does *not* always mean "the controller is deliberately
withholding this field because of a capability gate" (which is exactly what it meant for
`advertise_ap_name`). Sometimes it means the environment's config sync is stuck. Decompile
the emitter to tell the two apart before concluding anything.

### Controller-side UI quirks

- **Environment tab (AirView) stops updating ~10 s after mount**, with no user interaction:
  the row disappears, "No WiFi broadcasts found" renders, and the sidebar filters grey out.
  Clicking any other Time Range tab instantly restores everything. Verified the data is
  present server-side the whole time (10/10 direct `stat/rogueap` polls over 23 s returned
  all entries). Consistent with the table capturing `rowsPerPage` from the pre-fetch, empty
  selector result at mount (`useState({pageNumber:0,from:0,rowsPerPage:r.length})`) and never
  recomputing it. A genuine defect in the controller's own frontend, outside openUF's control.
- **Radios tab's "Type" filter shows nothing until one option is explicitly checked**, unlike
  Band/MIMO/Status on the same page, where an empty selection means "show all." "Type" here
  means the **AP's own uplink** connection type, so a wired-uplinked AP correctly appears
  under "Wired" — the radios themselves being wireless is irrelevant.
- **"Remove" on a client sends no wire command at all** — pure controller-side bookkeeping.
  A still-present client reappears on the very next inform.
- **The upgrade confirmation dialog truncates versions to 3 components**, so a genuine
  full-string mismatch can render as "Update U6 IW from 6.8.2 to 6.8.2?".

---

## Decompiling the controller

The controller is a Java app, and Java bytecode retains field-name string constants in the
class-file constant pool even under ProGuard-style class/method obfuscation — a far friendlier
analysis target than the AP's encrypted ARM firmware (see [dead ends](#dead-ends--do-not-re-attempt)).

**Procedure:**

1. Extract `/usr/lib/unifi/lib/internal/internal-dependencies.jar` from the container — the
   real ~29 MB application jar. (`ace.jar` is only a license-protected bootstrap `Launcher`.)
2. **Unzip it on a case-sensitive filesystem.** `com.ubnt.service.aa` and
   `com.ubnt.service.aA` — and ~55 other package pairs differing only by case — are distinct
   real packages. macOS silently folds them into one directory, corrupting the extraction and
   producing a decompile of the *wrong* class's method body with no warning. Do the
   `unzip` + decompile inside a Linux container (`docker cp` the jar into the controller
   image itself, which already has a JVM).
3. **Use CFR (`cfr.jar` 0.152) for large methods.** `jadx` silently drops method bodies it
   can't reconstruct — no marker, just absent output. The ~5,182-unit method that gates
   provisioning was invisible to jadx and decompiled cleanly under CFR. jadx is still fine
   for browsing and for properly-scoped class listings.
4. For frontend behavior, fetch the live controller's own React chunks
   (`react-app-wrapper.*.js`, `radiosPage.*.js`, `swai.*.js`, `airview.*.js`) and grep them.
   Where a decode function's logic matters, the webpack module registry
   (`window["webpackChunk…"].push([[Symbol()], {}, req => …])`) gives a direct reference to
   the **live** function, which can be called with a sweep of inputs — ground truth, not a guess.

**Logging:** the controller's loggers use flat, hand-picked names (`inform`, `adopt`,
`inform.uap`, `core.lock`, `web.api`), not package paths — see
`com.ubnt.service.system.HCKpgcBFPLu`. Setting `com.ubnt` to DEBUG does nothing for them. A
custom `logback.xml` with explicit `<logger name="inform" level="DEBUG"/>` entries, wired in
via `-Dlogback.configurationFile=`, is needed. Note that most handlers only log on their
*short-circuit* branch, so silence is consistent with everything passing normally.

## The inform protocol

### Envelope

Header layout, flags (`0x01` encrypted, `0x02` compressed), zlib-before-encrypt ordering,
AES-128-CBC + PKCS#7, and the default `http://unifi:8080/inform` URL all match openUF's
implementation and fxkr/unifi-protocol-reverse-engineering's published documentation.
`PKT_VERSION` is 1; the GCM AAD is the 40-byte header.

`mgmt_cfg` is a newline-delimited `key=value` **string**, not JSON.

### The GCM provisioning gate

**On 10.4.57 the controller will not provision a device until it has received a genuine
AES-GCM-encrypted inform.** `x_aes_gcm` is set *only* in the decrypt path — `InformServlet`
reads the packet's on-the-wire encryption flag (`header.isGcm()`) and the handler does
`dev.set("x_aes_gcm", true)`. **There is no JSON/payload field that sets it.** The controller
always requests GCM (`use_aes_gcm=true` is written unconditionally into every `mgmt_cfg`), and
once `x_aes_gcm` is set it rejects a GCM→CBC downgrade outright (`"tried to downgrade inform
encryption from AES-GCM to AES-CBC, rejecting"`).

The gate itself, in `MiVjHefaf`:

```java
if (!(dev.isUnsupported() || dev.aesGcmInformEncryptionOnly() || <globalFlag>)) {
    // "dev[..] : mgmt config update before provision"
    resp = new setparam; resp.put("mgmt_cfg", ...);
    dev.set("cfgversion", <fresh random 16-hex>);   // rolls every cycle
    return resp;                                     // returns BEFORE provisioning
}
```

`aesGcmInformEncryptionOnly()` just returns the device doc's `x_aes_gcm` boolean. While it is
false, **every** inform hits this branch, gets a brand-new random `cfgversion`, and returns
early — never reaching `cfgversion`-convergence provisioning, and never reaching the
`wait_for_initial_inform` clear.

**The diagnostic signature** of a device stuck here: adoption reports as completed, informs
decrypt fine, `last_seen` advances — but `cfgversion` is different on *every single* cycle,
`x_aes_gcm` stays false, `provisioned_at` is absent, and the UI shows "Adopting" forever.

Once GCM is sent, all of it resolves in one cycle: `x_aes_gcm` → true, `cfgversion` stabilises,
`provisioned_at` set, `wait_for_initial_inform` cleared, device Connected.

`crypto.lua`'s GCM code works against the `zhaozg/lua-openssl` binding with no changes. The
`openssl(1)` CLI fallback **cannot** do GCM (`enc` refuses AEAD ciphers), so a container
without a real binding silently downgrades to CBC and hangs on this gate.

### Adoption: L2 vs L3

**L3 (inform-only, no SSH).** The controller logs `discovered via L3 inform, skip SSH adoption`
and delivers the new `authkey` directly in the `mgmt_cfg` of the `setparam` sent right after
the Adopt click:

```json
{"_type":"setparam","mgmt_cfg":"capability=notif,notif-assoc-stat\nselfrun_guest_mode=pass\ncfgversion=e07e7991b8c62b47\nled_enabled=true\nstun_url=stun://172.19.0.4:3478/\nmgmt_url=https://172.19.0.4:8443/manage/site/default\nauthkey=ccc32a3bbe40157773294de8ed683627\ninform_url=http://172.19.0.4:8080/inform\nuse_aes_gcm=true\nreport_crash=true\n","server_time_in_utc":"1783841863822"}
```

openUF accepts a hex32 `authkey` from `mgmt_cfg` **only while `st.adopted == false`** — while
unadopted the device is still using the well-known default key, so this exchange carries no
less confidentiality than the rest of L3 provisioning already assumes.

**L2 (broadcast discovery + real SSH).** With `announce.lua` broadcasting, the controller runs
genuine SSH on the Adopt click and executes `syswrapper.sh set-adopt <url> <key>`. The existing
`syswrapper.lua`/`state.lua` shape (`adopted`, `authkey`, `inform_url`, `cfgversion`, `use_gcm`)
is what real SSH adoption expects — confirmed by a real round-trip.

Two things real hardware does that the validation container had to be taught:

- The controller's SSH client (`sshj`) offers only legacy `ssh-rsa` (SHA-1), matching aging
  UBNT firmware; OpenSSH ≥8.8 excludes it by default. `HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa` /
  `PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa` are needed in `sshd_config`.
- The controller authenticates as the Ubiquiti factory-default account **`ubnt`/`ubnt`**, not
  the admin-configured Device SSH credentials — correct behavior, because `announce.lua`'s
  `IsDefault` byte (`0x17` in the TLV blob, `make_blob_17_1a`) correctly declares the device
  unadopted.

`mgmt_url` is the **web UI deep link** (`https://host:8443/manage/site/default`), *not* an
alias for `inform_url`. Treating them as the same key makes the device overwrite its working
inform endpoint on the first routine post-adopt `setparam` and disappear permanently.

### Response `_type`s

The complete set, per `InformServlet`: `noop`, `setparam`, `cmd`, `upgrade`, `reboot`,
`setdefault`. There is no export/backup/dump command.

| `_type` | Shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `noop` | `{"_type":"noop","interval":…}` | Steady state. |
| `setparam` | `{"_type":"setparam","mgmt_cfg":"…","system_cfg":"…","server_time_in_utc":"…"}` | Both configs are flat `key=value` blobs. See [system_cfg](#system_cfg-the-real-config-channel). |
| `cmd` | `{"_type":"cmd","cmd":"…","mac":"…","device_id":"…",…}` | See command table below. |
| `upgrade` | `{"_type":"upgrade","version":"6.8.2.15592","md5sum":"…","url":"http://fw-download.ubnt.com/…"}` | Fire-and-forget, sent exactly once; no retry, no confirmation expected. |
| `reboot` | `{"_type":"reboot","reboot_type":"soft",…}` | The top-level form is the real one; `{"_type":"cmd","cmd":"restart"}` is not the path this action takes. `reboot_type` is unused by openUF. |
| `setdefault` | — | Handler exists but has never been observed dispatched live; see [open questions](#open-questions). |

**After executing a `cmd`, the device must send another inform immediately** (documented by
fxkr and confirmed live: the controller's next `noop` lands in the same second).

Confirmed `cmd` strings:

| `cmd` | Trigger | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `set-locate` | Locate button | `{"cmd":"set-locate","device_id":…}` |
| `block-sta` | Block client | `{"cmd":"block-sta","mac":"…"}` |
| `unblock-sta` | Unblock client | `{"cmd":"unblock-sta","mac":"…"}` |
| `spectrum-scan` | — | Handler implemented; no UI affordance found in 10.4.57 to fire it. |

Block/unblock are **one-shot commands**, not persistent per-inform state. The candidate
persistent field `include_blocks` (present on every response) was ruled out — it stays `[]`
even while a client is genuinely blocked. The device is expected to remember the block itself,
which is why `state.json` carries `blocked_stas` and `firewall.reconcile()` runs at startup.

---

## `system_cfg`: the real config channel

**A real controller never sends `resp.vap_table` / `radio_table` / `network_table` as JSON.**
All device configuration — WiFi, radios, IP settings, per-port VLAN, minimum RSSI — arrives
inside the flat, OpenWrt/hostapd-style `system_cfg` key=value blob on a `setparam`.
`inform.lua`'s `M._parse_wifi_system_cfg()` translates it into the `{radio_table, vap_table}`
shape `ucihelper.apply_config()` expects.

Conventions used throughout: booleans are `"enabled"`/`"disabled"` (sometimes `"true"`/`"1"`);
an **absent block means disabled** — there is generally no explicit `status=false`.

### `aaa.<n>.*` — per-SSID security

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ssid` | SSID |
| `id` | The wlanconf Mongo ObjectId. **Must be echoed back** — see [`vap_table`](#vap_table-entry). |
| `wpa` | WPA protocol version (`2`/`3`). Stays `2` even for a WPA2/WPA3 transition WLAN. |
| `wpa.psk` | Passphrase |
| `wpa.key.<k>.mgmt` | AKM set (`WPA-PSK`, `SAE`, …). **This**, not `wpa`, is what distinguishes SAE. |
| `pmf.status` / `pmf.mode` | 802.11w. `mode` is `0`\|`1`\|`2` (disabled/optional/required), mapping 1:1 onto hostapd's `ieee80211w`. On this madwifi model, **WPA2/WPA3 transition intent is carried entirely by these fields** — dropping them silently collapses mixed mode to plain WPA2. |
| `pmf.cipher` | `AES-128-CMAC`. Not translated — hostapd's default BIP group-mgmt cipher already is this. |
| `ft.status` | Fast Roaming (802.11r). **The only FT field on the wire** — no `mobility_domain`/`r0kh`/`r1kh`, which the controller computes and syncs internally across the site. `ucihelper.derive_mobility_domain()` fills that gap locally. |
| `bss_transition` | 802.11v. Present on every band's block, flips independently of Fast Roaming. |
| `br.devname` | `br0` untagged, **`br0.<vlan>`** when the WLAN is assigned to a VLAN network. This suffix is the *only* VLAN signal — there is no `network_table`/`networkconf_id` join anywhere in the wire format. |
| `sae.anti_clogging` / `sae.sync` | Plain integers, emitted only when > 0 **and** the WLAN is genuinely WPA3 (see below). |
| `driver` | `madwifi` — confirms the controller is talking to this model as madwifi-era firmware, which explains several value encodings below. |

A VLAN assignment also produces companion `vlan.*` (`vlan.1.devname=eth0`, `vlan.1.id=20`),
`bridge.*`, and `netconf.*` blocks. openUF does not need to reproduce these — real hardware's
OpenWrt network stack builds them from the UCI config `ucihelper` writes.

**SAE gating.** `com.ubnt.service.config.ubntconf.OXMua`'s emitter is capability-gate-free:

```
n = wlan.getInt("sae_anti_clogging", -1); if (n > 0) emit "aaa.<idx>.sae.anti_clogging" = n
s = wlan.getInt("sae_sync", -1);          if (s > 0) emit "aaa.<idx>.sae.sync" = s
```

but is only *called* when `wlan.isWpa3() || wlan.isOn6GHzBand()`. `isWpa3()` reads a distinct
admin-facing DB flag `wpa3_support` (default false) — **not** the "WPA2/WPA3" mixed dropdown
choice. So a mixed-mode WLAN never emits either key, even with non-default values saved
server-side. openUF maps these to hostapd's `sae_anti_clogging_threshold` / `sae_sync`
(the older name, still the broadly-supported one across the OpenWrt/wpad versions targeted).

### `wireless.<n>.*` — per-SSID radio binding and behavior

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ssid`, `parent` | SSID, and the owning radio (`radio0`/`radio1`) |
| `dtim_period` | Plain integer, **always present** regardless of the WLAN's Auto/Custom DTIM toggle. There is no `dtim_mode`/`dtim_ng`/`dtim_na` key on the wire — go-unifi's band-split shape describes the REST API, not this protocol. |
| `no2ghz_oui` | **Band Steering's real wire representation.** Not a per-device `mgmt_cfg` field. Toggling Band Steering changes only this key, and only on the 2.4 GHz entry (the 5 GHz entry stays `disabled` — nothing to toggle there). A madwifi/QCA convention: omitting the AP's OUI from 2.4 GHz beacons nudges dual-band clients toward 5 GHz. Mainline mac80211/hostapd has no equivalent, so openUF derives a single device-wide `steering_active` boolean (true if *any* vap has it) and drives `usteer`, which is itself a device-wide daemon. |
| `mcast.enhance` | Multicast Enhancement / Multicast-to-Unicast. `0`\|`1`. |
| `advertise_ap_name` | "Show Access Point Name in Beacon". **Only emitted when the device declares `wifi_caps2` bit `0x40`** — see [capability bitmasks](#capability-bitmasks). |

### `radio.<n>.*` — per-radio config

`phyname` (`radio0`), `channel` (integer or the literal `auto`), `txpower` (integer or `auto`),
`txpower_mode` (`custom`), `status`. When no radio is provisionable the blob contains the
literal comment `# no wlan provisioned as no radio found` and `radio.status=disabled` — see
[`radio_table` must not be empty](#radio_table-entry).

### `stamgr.<n>.*` — per-radio Station Manager (Minimum RSSI)

Indexed the same as `radio.<n>`, **not** tied to any SSID. This is a device/radio-level
setting (Devices → [AP] → Radios), not a WLAN one — distinct from the WLAN Advanced panel's
"Roaming Assistant", which is a different feature with its own REST fields
(`roamingAssistantNaEnabled`/`Rssi`) that never appear on the wire.

```
stamgr.1.status=true
stamgr.1.radio=ng
stamgr.1.minrssi.status=true
stamgr.1.minrssi.rssi=15
stamgr.1.loadbalance.status=false
```

**The threshold is not plain dBm.** UI `-80 dBm` → wire `15`; UI `-85 dBm` → wire `10` —
consistent with `wire = dbm + 95`, an offset from an assumed -95 dBm noise floor (a madwifi
convention, matching `aaa.1.driver=madwifi`). openUF stores the raw wire value in UCI and
converts to dBm only where a live noise-floor reading exists (`sysinfo.radio_stats()`'s
`iw survey dump` parse), falling back to the -95 assumption otherwise.

`loadbalance.status` is a sibling sub-feature sharing the block; unimplemented.

**Enforcement semantics** (from web research — this is client-facing AP behavior, not a wire
format): Minimum RSSI is a **roaming aid, not a block**. The AP sends a single deauth frame to
a below-threshold client; there is no persistent drop rule and the client may reassociate
immediately, even to the same AP. This is materially different from `block-sta`, so it has its
own helper, `ucihelper.kick_station()`, rather than reusing `firewall.deauth()`.

### `netconf.*` / `dhcpc.*` / `route.*` / `resolv.*` — IP settings

```
netconf.1.devname=br0
netconf.1.ip=172.19.0.50
netconf.1.netmask=255.255.255.0
netconf.1.autoip.status=disabled
route.1.gateway=172.19.0.1
resolv.nameserver.1.ip=192.168.1.1
resolv.host.1.name=<device name>      # also the source for wps_device_name
dhcpc.status=enabled
dhcpc.1.status / dhcpc.1.devname      # the actual DHCP-vs-static signal
```

**A fresh device's very first post-adopt `setparam` always carries `dhcpc.1.status=enabled`** —
a brand-new device is in DHCP by definition. Acting on that unconditionally (flush + `udhcpc`)
strands the interface if no DHCP server can grant a fresh lease. `netconfig.apply_dhcp` is
therefore only called when `st.ip_mode == "static"` already, i.e. when genuinely reverting our
own prior static push; first contact and steady-state reaffirmations are a no-op, matching how
real hardware's continuously-running DHCP client needs no manual re-invocation.

### `switch.*` — per-port VLAN

Appears only once the device declares switch capability. `switch.status`,
`switch.vlan.status`, `switch.vlan.N.id/mode/status`, `switch.port.N.name/opmode` — one entry
per the model registry's port count, **not** per whatever `port_table` openUF actually reports.

openUF does not parse or apply this block. Nothing depends on it: the controller manages VLAN
membership server-side and only needs the device to *accept* the port-override push.

---

## Outbound payload field reference

Everything openUF sends. Names were audited against the controller's own Device model
(`com.ubnt.data.cVbZoFIZsWYaVCquTr` and its ~90 nested per-sub-object classes).

### Top level

| Field | Value / notes |
|---|---|
| `_type` | `"state"` |
| `default`, `state` | `not adopted`; `2` connected / `0` unadopted |
| `mac`, `serial`, `model`, `platform`, `hostname`, `ip` | `serial` is the MAC with colons stripped |
| `inform_url`, `cfgversion`, `uptime`, `time` | |
| **`version`** | **Bare firmware version only — never model-prefixed.** See below. |
| `required_version`, `bootrom_version`, `country_code` | `bootrom_version` has no counterpart anywhere in the device schema (closest is `boot_time`, a timestamp); likely ignored, left as-is for want of evidence to rename it to. |
| `mem_total`, **`mem_used`** | Bytes. `mem_used = total − free`; the schema has `mem_used`, not `mem_free`. |
| **`system-stats`** | Hyphenated key, `{cpu, mem, uptime}` — all three **strings**, cpu/mem as percentages. Not `sys_stats`, and not loadavgs. `cpu` is `0` on the very first inform (delta-sampling `/proc/stat` has no prior sample). |
| **`fw_caps`** | `0x110` — see [capability bitmasks](#capability-bitmasks) |
| **`wifi_caps2`** | `0x40` — see [capability bitmasks](#capability-bitmasks) |
| `spectrum_scanning`, `spectrum_scan_timestamp` | **Device-level**, not per-radio (the per-radio fields are `spectrum_table`/`spectrum_table_time`) |
| `if_table[]` | `name`, `mac`, `rx_bytes`, `tx_bytes`, `rx_packets`, `tx_packets`, `rx_errors`, `tx_errors` |
| `radio_table[]`, `radio_table_stats[]`, `vap_table[]`, `scan_radio_table[]`, `port_table[]`, `lldp_table[]` | See below |

**Why `version` must be bare.** The upgrade-offer gate in `MiVjHefaf`:

```java
private boolean chgwykfBxZCAuEHPPQ(String string, String string2) {
    return this.TgovGTpPRqBiOa(string) && !StringUtils.equals(string, string2);
}
// object3 = ProductInfo.version         -- e.g. "6.8.2.15592" (bare)
// string  = inform.getString("version")
```

A **strict, unnormalized `StringUtils.equals`** — no prefix stripping, no numeric parsing.
Sending `"U6IW.6.8.2.15592"` never matches `"6.8.2.15592"`, so the "Update Available" banner is
permanent regardless of the actual firmware version. The catalog's version is confirmed bare
by the controller's own startup log: `firmware[U6IW] new version (6.8.2.15592) is available`.

`fw.pre` (`"U6IW."`) remains correct and untouched in `announce.lua`'s L2 discovery
"firmware version verbose" TLV — a different protocol surface. Do not reuse it here.

### Capability bitmasks

| Field | Bit | Controller method | Effect if absent |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fw_caps` | `0x10` (16) | `Device.hasQCASwitch()` = `hasFirmwareCapability(16)` | The Ports view's projection of `port_table` into the device DTO doesn't happen. Wired-client *ingestion* is gated only on `isSwitch()` (a model-registry property), so clients still appear in the list — but the Ports view stays empty. |
| `fw_caps` | `0x100` (256) | `Device.hasOWRTSwitch()` = `hasFirmwareCapability(256)` | Per-port VLAN assignment is rejected outright — see below. |
| `wifi_caps2` | `0x40` (64) | `Device.supportAdvertisingDeviceNameInBeacon()` = `hasWifiCapability2(64)` | The controller never emits `wireless.<n>.advertise_ap_name` at all, and doesn't even re-push config on the toggle. |

`wifi_caps2` is a **second, entirely separate** bitmask from `wifi_caps` (which gates
`supportBandsteering()`/`supportZeroHandoff()` — openUF sets neither). Only bit `0x40` is
claimed; the mask also gates Mesh MLO, assisted roaming, and quick/neighbour scan, which
openUF does not implement and must not claim.

**The per-port VLAN validator** (`com.ubnt.ace.api.e.VVyiC`, reachable only once
`hasQCASwitch()` is true):

```java
private void chgwykfBxZCAuEHPPQ(UCthhvfQNZ port, boolean hasOWRTSwitch, boolean hasSwitchVlanCap8) {
    nwTNVfYOnNbEWSoCkPq.guoZiIiLhURleoJ(port).ifPresent(forwardMode -> {
        if (!((forwardMode != ALL && forwardMode != CUSTOMIZE) || hasOWRTSwitch)) {
            throw new QnvUxbsXyAJZ(VLAN_TAGGING_UNSUPPORTED, ...);
        }
        if (hasSwitchVlanCap8 && forwardMode NOT IN {CUSTOMIZE, NATIVE, DISABLED}) {
            throw new QnvUxbsXyAJZ(VLAN_TAGGING_UNSUPPORTED, ...);
        }
    });
}
```

For a port with no explicit `forward` override — the default `ALL` mode, true for every port
openUF sends — the first branch collapses to `!hasOWRTSwitch()`. Without bit `0x100`, **every
default-mode port is unconditionally rejected** with `api.err.VlanTaggingUnsupportedByDevice`,
before `vlan_caps` or anything port-specific is consulted. (Sweeping `switch_caps.vlan_caps`
through 0/3/4/5/6/7/15/31/255 only changed *which* of two near-identical errors fired.)
"OpenWrt switch" as opposed to a QCA hardware switch ASIC is, fittingly, exactly what this is.

### `radio_table[]` entry

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `name` | UCI device name (`radio0`) |
| **`radio`** | **The band** (`ng`/`na`), from `band_for_channel()` — channels 1-14 → `ng`, else `na`. Parsed by `com.ubnt.g.f.e.rYtJfMBbtgWvku`'s `String.toLowerCase()` factory, which has **no null guard**: omitting this field throws an NPE inside the controller's adopt processing on *every* inform, corrupting its UI-facing device cache (Devices list shows "No UniFi Devices Have Been Adopted" while Mongo says adopted). 60 GHz/6 GHz aren't disambiguable from channel number alone and are unsupported. |
| `channel` | Live negotiated channel from `iw dev`, more authoritative than UCI's value (frequently the literal `"auto"`, which the controller will not resolve to a number) |
| **`ht`**, **`tx_power`** | Not `htmode`/`txpower` |
| `disabled`, `builtin_antenna`, `builtin_ant_gain`, `max_txpower` | |
| `nss`, `is_11ac`, `is_11ax`, `is_11be`, `has_dfs`, `has_fccdfs`, `has_ht160`, `has_eht240`, `has_eht320` | Read directly off each entry by `PGOcbDWlbnYQdFW`'s `copyAttrsIfPresent`, **independent of `radio_caps`**. Derived by `sysinfo.radio_caps()` from `iw phy phyN info`. |
| **`radio_caps`** | A separate **integer bitmask**, not `nss`. See below. |
| `min_rssi`, `min_rssi_enabled` | `min_rssi` is **dBm** on the wire (converted from the raw `stamgr` units using the live noise floor) |
| **`athstats`** | Nested `{cu_total, cu_self_rx, cu_self_tx, cu_interf}`. See below. |

**An empty `radio_table` blocks a large amount of downstream behavior.** The controller checks
`if (list3.isEmpty()) { … "Missing radio_table in inform…" }` and this is exactly the
"no radio found" condition that suppresses WLAN provisioning. Real OpenWrt hardware has genuine
`wifi-device` sections populated by the driver at boot, independent of any configured SSID.

**`radio_caps` MIMO bits.** The controller's Java side only ever passes this int through
verbatim (`uCthhvfQNZ2.put("radio_caps", uCthhvfQNZ3.getInt("radio_caps", 0))`); the decode into
`"1x1"`…`"4x4"` happens **client-side only**, in the Radios tab's `mimo: e7(radio.radio_caps)`.
Reverse-engineered by calling the live `e7` decoder through the webpack module registry with a
single-bit sweep:

| `nss` | bit |
|---|---|
| 1 | `0x8` |
| 2 | `0x10` |
| 3 | `0x20` |
| 4 | `0x4000000` |

Checked highest-first when multiple bits are set. It is **not** simply `radio_caps == nss`
(live-tested and refuted). Left at the default `0`, the MIMO column is blank *and* the
1x1–4x4 filter checkboxes exclude the radio outright rather than merely filtering it wrong.

**`athstats` is required for the "Avg. Interference"/"Avg. Airtime" columns.** The archiver
method `com.ubnt.service.system.x.htDMji` iterates `radio_table` — not `radio_table_stats`, not
`vap_table` — and:

```java
if (!uCthhvfQNZ.containsField("athstats")) continue;
```

then reads `cu_total`/`cu_self_rx`/`cu_self_tx`/`satisfaction`/`cu_interf` off that nested
sub-object. Sending the same four fields on `radio_table_stats` and `vap_table` (both real, both
used by other paths) leaves every archived bucket without them. Named after the legacy Atheros
`ath9k`/`ath10k` stats struct UniFi firmware historically exposed under this name.

### `radio_table_stats[]` entry

Parallel to `radio_table` — the real controller's own split of static config vs. live stats.

`name`, `channel`, `cu_total`, **`cu_self_rx`**, **`cu_self_tx`** (two separate fields, not one
combined `cu_self`), `cu_interf`, plus `spectrum_table` / `spectrum_table_time` when a
`spectrum-scan` cmd has populated `M._spectrum_cache`.

All `cu_*` are percentages derived from `iw dev <ifname> survey dump`;
`cu_interf = max(0, cu_total − cu_self_rx − cu_self_tx)` — airtime busy for reasons other than
this radio's own tx/rx.

> **`iw` survey field names.** The real binary prints `channel active time:`,
> `channel busy time:`, `channel receive time:`, `channel transmit time:` — *not*
> `channel time:`/`channel time busy:`/etc. Patterns must be anchored to line start so
> `channel busy time:` doesn't also match inside `extension channel busy time:`, which `iw`
> emits on wider channels.

`spectrum_table[]` entries carry `channel`, `center_freq`, `width`, `utilization`,
`interference` (field names recovered from two independent Lombok DTO constant pools).
`channel`/`center_freq`/`utilization` come mechanically from survey dump; `width` and
`interference` are best-effort — see [best-effort fields](#best-effort-and-unverified-fields).

### `vap_table[]` entry

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `name` | UCI section name |
| **`essid`** | Not `ssid` |
| **`id`** and **`wlanconf_id`** | Both carry the wlanconf ObjectId from `aaa.<n>.id`. **Mandatory.** See below. |
| **`radio`** | The **band** (`ng`/`na`), same enum as `radio_table`. Sending `radio0` here logs `WARN stat - unexpected radio[radio0] while processing stats` on every inform and silently drops that vap's stats aggregation. |
| **`radio_name`** | The UCI device name (`radio0`) — a separate, real field on the same DTO. This is what `get_ifname_for_radio()` needs. |
| `encryption`, `disabled`, `bssid`, `channel`, `tx_power`, `usage` | `usage` is `"user"` |
| `num_sta` | Coexists with the nested `sta_table` on the real DTO |
| `rx_bytes`, `tx_bytes`, `rx_packets`, `tx_packets`, `tx_retries`, `tx_dropped` | The UI's "Air Stats" panel. `iw` exposes these only per-station, so they're summed across connected stations while building `sta_table`. `rx_dropped`/`rx_errors`/`tx_errors`/`satisfaction` have no source in `iw` output at all — left unset rather than invented (802.11 ARQ retry/failure counters are inherently TX-side only). |
| `avg_client_signal` | Mean `signal` of associated clients, dBm. Omitted entirely when the VAP has no clients. |
| `cu_total`, `cu_self_rx`, `cu_self_tx`, `cu_interf` | Mirrored from the radio |
| `sta_table[]` | Nested — see below |

**`id` is mandatory or the entire VAP is discarded.** `com.ubnt.service.devmgr.c.KHUkYjHujLgFBD`
(vapInformProcessor) filters the raw `vap_table` *before* any per-station processing runs. For a
`usage=user` VAP it requires a non-`"unknown"` `id`, then re-looks it up via
`configCache.get(siteId, id)` to attach `wlanconf_id`/`ap_mac`/`site_id`/`is_guest`/`is_wep`.
A missing `id` is checked with `!"unknown".equals(id)` and drops the VAP **silently** —
no log line, no error, taking the nested `sta_table` and every wireless client with it.
The `"Inconsistent vap"`/`"Invalid id"` warn paths only fire on an actual lookup *failure*.

**"Air Stats" needs growing counters, not just non-zero ones.** The widget renders a
rate/delta between informs. Static counters produce a zero delta even when the absolute value
is correct — which is why `iw-mock.sh`'s fake counters must increase monotonically.

### `sta_table[]` entry (nested inside each `vap_table` entry)

Nested, **not** a flat top-level `user_table`.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `active`, `mac`, `ap_mac`, `channel`, `radio` | `active` is always `true` — an entry only exists while `iw station dump` lists the station |
| `signal`, `rssi` | Both the same value; `iw` exposes no separately-measured RSSI |
| `rx_bytes`, `tx_bytes`, `rx_packets`, `tx_packets` | **Raw cumulative counters.** The vapInformProcessor computes its own `tx_bytes-d`/`rx_bytes-d`/`bytes-d`/`bytes-r` deltas server-side keyed by `time_delta` — never send a pre-computed rate here. |
| `tx_rate`, `rx_rate` | **Kbps** (`iw` reports Mbit/s, so ×1000) |
| `uptime`, `idletime` | `iw`'s "connected time" / "inactive time", both in seconds |
| **`tx_mcs`**, `rx_mcs` | Not `tx_mcs_index` (that name is only the ucore-message JSON name for a different internal event). Absent for legacy pre-11n rates. |
| `nss` | Read directly by the controller, no derivation |
| `radio_proto` | Read only by the **disconnect-time** archive path (`TtZhv`) |
| **`is_11n`, `is_11ac`, `is_11ax`, `is_11be`** | What the **live** display actually uses — see below |
| `wifi_tx_attempts`, `wifi_tx_retries_percentage` | `attempts = tx_packets + tx_retries` |
| `satisfaction`, `satisfaction_now` | Best-effort estimate — see below |
| `capacity`, `throughput`, `linkscore`, `multicast` | Best-effort / placeholders — see below |
| `name` | Omitted — controller/admin-assigned, no local source |

The attribute list `KHUkYjHujLgFBD` copies verbatim off each incoming entry is exactly:
`"channel", "radio", "name", "signal", "rssi", "tx_rate", "rx_rate", "tx_packets",
"rx_packets", "tx_bytes", "rx_bytes"`.

**Why the `is_11*` booleans matter more than `radio_proto`.** The live, still-connected client
display is computed by `com.ubnt.service.devmgr.HCKpgcBFPLu` → `com.ubnt.g.s.jRsSex`, which
**ignores the `radio_proto` string entirely**:

```java
private static jRsSex lhPagEPcc(UCthhvfQNZ uCthhvfQNZ) {  // 2.4GHz (ng) path
    if (uCthhvfQNZ.is("is_11be", false)) return BE;
    if (uCthhvfQNZ.is("is_11ax", false)) return AX;
    if (uCthhvfQNZ.is("is_11n",  false)) return NG;
    if (uCthhvfQNZ.is("is_11b",  false)) return B;
    return G;   // fallthrough when none are set
}
```

Sending only `radio_proto` leaves every live client showing `"g"` (2.4 GHz) or `"a"` (5 GHz),
while `nss` — read directly, no derivation — works immediately. Both must be sent.

**Generation/NSS derivation** from `iw`'s own bitrate line tokens (format strings confirmed via
`strings /usr/sbin/iw`):

| Token | Generation | NSS |
|---|---|---|
| bare `MCS N` | `n` | `floor(N/8)+1` (HT MCS layout: 0-7 = 1 stream, 8-15 = 2, …) |
| `VHT-MCS` / `VHT-NSS` | `ac` | read directly |
| `HE-MCS` / `HE-NSS` | `ax` | read directly |
| `EHT-MCS` / `EHT-NSS` | `be` | read directly |
| none (legacy) | falls back to the band: `a` on `na`, `g` on `ng` | 1 |

Never `b` — real dual-band 11n+ hardware doesn't negotiate down to 802.11b-only rates.

**`satisfaction` is a device-computed field.** The controller's `wifi_experience_score` is a
straight passthrough — `com.ubnt.service.l.e.AcrQJeJCScLn`:
`wifi_experience_score = doc.getOptionalInt("satisfaction")`. The wireless-client model
(`com.ubnt.service.l.e.AQODNNoMmBlFpWXX`) reads `satisfaction`, `satisfaction_now`,
`satisfaction_real`, `satisfaction_reason`, `wifi_tx_attempts`, `wifi_tx_retries_percentage`,
`tx_mcs`, `ccq`, `noise`, `nss` as **plain data**; the controller computes nothing itself beyond
a running `satisfaction_avg` accumulator. Real AP firmware computes it on-device with a
proprietary formula. Sending nothing renders as "No Experience", correctly.

### `port_table[]` entry

Processed only when `Device.isSwitch()` is true for the reported model —
`hasFeature(UiHQyVmgX) || hasFeature(yojQKHv)`. The model registry
(`com.ubnt.data.dhdeXcHqLRBKMUZk`) registers `U6IW` as device type `uap` with **5 ethernet
ports** and the switch feature, matching reality (a U6-InWall has a built-in 4-port downstream
switch). A plain AP like `U6MP` is not a switch. So for the model openUF impersonates, this is
not optional: an empty `port_table` means zero wired clients can ever appear.

One entry per `cfg.net.ports` (modelmap field `{idx, ifname, uplink}`, defaulting to
`{wan_cpueth=uplink, lan_cpueth=lan}`):

`port_idx` (1-based), `name`, `media`, `up`, `enable`, `speed`, `full_duplex`, `is_uplink`,
`speed_caps`, `port_poe`, `poe_caps`, and `rx_bytes`/`tx_bytes`/`rx_packets`/`tx_packets`/
`rx_errors`/`tx_errors` from the same `sysinfo.interfaces()` counters `if_table` uses.

**Non-uplink ports additionally carry `mac_table[]`** — `{mac, ip, hostname, age, uptime}`,
sourced by `sysinfo.mac_table(ifname)` joining `bridge fdb show dev <ifname>` (dynamic
`master br-lan` entries only; `self`/`permanent` lines and multicast/broadcast MACs filtered
out) with `/proc/net/arp` for IPs and `/tmp/dhcp.leases` when present for hostnames (optional —
an AP is usually not the DHCP server; `hostname` stays absent rather than invented).

Ports flagged `is_uplink: true` are skipped by the controller for client creation, since that
port faces the controller's own network.

Two exclusion filters prevent double-reporting: the device's **own** MACs, and any MAC
currently associated as a wireless station — a wireless client bridged into `br-lan` genuinely
appears in the bridge FDB too.

**Wired hosts will never show per-client traffic**, by design. `TtZhv` reads only
`mac`/`ip`/`hostname`/`age`/`uptime` off each `mac_table` entry; there is no per-client byte
counter anywhere in the wired-client wire protocol. A wired client's traffic is attributed via
its switch port's own counters.

### `scan_radio_table[]` entry

Backs Insights → AirView → **Environment** (`GET /api/s/default/stat/rogueap`). Built from
`iw dev <ifname> scan dump` — the kernel's already-cached BSS list, cheap and non-disruptive,
unlike the `spectrum-scan` cmd's real scan trigger.

Nested shape (confirmed against `PGOcbDWlbnYQdFW`, which reads a top-level `scan_radio_table`
array and hands each entry's nested `scan_table` to the ingestion service — not a flat list):

```
scan_radio_table[] = { radio, name, scan_table[] }
```

Per `scan_table[]` entry — the consumer DTO `com.ubnt.service.aO.bLwwMKkr` (literally named
`"PeerScan"` in its own builder's `toString`) confirms the full field list:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `mac`, `bssid`, `essid`, `channel`, `freq`, `signal`, `rssi`, `security` | |
| `radio`, `radio_name` | |
| **`band`** | A field **distinct from `radio`** but taking the identical enum values. The Environment tab's list selector applies an *unconditional* filter upstream of every visible sidebar filter: `A.filter(A=>!!T.R?.[A?.band]?.[A?.bw>0?A.bw:m.L?.[A?.band]])`. `T.R[undefined]` is `undefined`, so an entry without `band` fails silently for every row — indistinguishable from "no data", regardless of filter state. |
| **`bw`** | Channel width MHz. The "Ch. Width" cell reads it directly and renders nothing when falsy: `renderCell:({bw:A})=>A?…:null`. Parsed from `iw`'s `BSS operating channel width: N MHz` (only present for HE/VHT-capable neighbours), defaulting to `20` — legacy-safe and valid on both bands. |
| **`age`** | **Elapsed seconds, not an absolute timestamp.** The ingestion code reads `getInt("age")` and computes `last_seen = report_time − age` itself; it also **silently drops any entry with `age >= 30`** as a staleness guard. Sending an absolute timestamp under either key yields an empty result with no error. Parsed from `iw`'s `last seen: N ms ago`. |

`is_rogue` is much narrower than the tab name suggests: set true only when a neighbouring BSSID
broadcasts the **same essid as one of the site's own configured networks** (an evil-twin check
raising `EVT_AP_DetectRogueAP`). Ordinary neighbours correctly have `is_rogue: false` and still
appear in the Environment list.

### `lldp_table[]` entry

Field names from the real DTO (`OXMua`): `chassis_descr`, `chassis_id`, `local_port_name`,
`local_port_idx`, `is_wired`, `port_id`, `port_descr`.

- `chassis_descr` comes from `chassis.descr`, **not** `chassis.name` — System Description and
  System Name are different LLDP TLVs.
- `local_port_idx` is read from `/sys/class/net/<port>/ifindex` — this is *our own* local
  interface, not something lldpctl reports about the neighbour, so it is a local sysfs lookup
  rather than a protocol field. Omitted when unavailable.
- `is_wired` is unconditionally `true` — LLDP is inherently a wired-link protocol.

### Best-effort and unverified fields

These are explicitly approximations, flagged as such in the code. Listed here so nobody mistakes
them for measured values.

| Field | Status |
|---|---|
| `sta_table[].capacity` | Negotiated `tx_bitrate` (Mbps, floored) as a proxy for "available bandwidth to this client" |
| `sta_table[].throughput` | Delta-sampled byte rate (bytes/sec); `0` on first sample for a given MAC |
| `sta_table[].linkscore`, `.multicast` | `0` placeholders — **no local source and no public reference found for either.** Neither `paultyng/go-unifi`'s `User` model nor `unpoller/unifi`'s `clients.go` has them at all. Still needs live-capture verification. |
| `sta_table[].satisfaction` | `estimate_satisfaction()`: worse of a signal score (−85 dBm → 0, −50 dBm → 100) and a retry score (`100 − retries%`), matching community descriptions of the real behavior. A proxy for Ubiquiti's undocumented on-device formula. |
| `spectrum_table[].width` | The radio's configured `htmode` (e.g. `HT40` → 40) as a uniform approximation — no live-scan source gives per-channel width |
| `spectrum_table[].interference` | Raw noise-floor dBm passed through; `iw survey dump` has no equivalent metric |
| `ucihelper` `wps_device_name` / `ap_setup_locked` | Standards-based rather than Ubiquiti-derived — see the beacon row in the [feature matrix](#feature-matrix) |
| `usteer.lua`'s `USTEER_DEFAULTS` | Guessed `/etc/config/usteer` option names; verify against the package's own shipped defaults if usteer is ever installed in the validation container |

## Feature matrix

Every controller-UI control exercised against a live openUF device. "Confirmed" means driven
through the real UI with the resulting wire payload captured or the effect verified.

| # | Control / feature | Wire mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Adopt (L2/SSH, L3/mgmt_cfg) | SSH `syswrapper.sh set-adopt`, or `authkey` in `mgmt_cfg` | ✅ Confirmed both paths |
| 2 | Baseline post-adopt inform | `setparam` + `mgmt_cfg` | ✅ Confirmed |
| 3 | SSID push (no VLAN) | `system_cfg` `aaa.*`/`wireless.*`/`radio.*` | ✅ Confirmed |
| 4 | VLAN-tagged network + SSID assignment | `aaa.<n>.br.devname = br0.<vlan>` | ✅ Confirmed |
| 5 | Fast Roaming (802.11r) | `aaa.<n>.ft.status` only | ✅ Confirmed by byte-for-byte `system_cfg` diff, both directions |
| 6 | TX power / channel per radio | `radio.<n>.channel`/`.txpower`/`.txpower_mode` | ✅ Confirmed |
| 7 | Locate | `cmd:"set-locate"` | ✅ Confirmed. LED *hardware* effect untestable here (`dev.conf.led` is nil); covered by `tests/test_led.lua` |
| 8 | RF/spectrum scan trigger | `cmd:"spectrum-scan"` | ⚠️ Handler implemented and unit-tested; **no manual trigger control exists anywhere in 10.4.57's UI** (AirView is entirely passive), so never fired live. Nothing contradicts the handler's correctness. |
| 9 | Firmware upgrade | `_type:"upgrade"` | ✅ Confirmed. openUF stores `upgrade_requested_version`/`_url` and logs — it never downloads, verifies, flashes, or reboots. Verified live: no side effects, device stayed Connected. The pushed `md5sum`/filename match Ubiquiti's real CDN artifact byte-for-byte. |
| 10 | Forget device / factory reset | `_type:"setdefault"` | ⚠️ UI action and server-side deletion work, but **no `setdefault` was ever dispatched on the wire**; handler unverified. See [open questions](#open-questions). |
| 11 | `fw.ver` acceptance | — | ✅ Accepted verbatim, no validation beyond storage |
| 12 | Restart | `_type:"reboot"` (top-level, **not** `cmd:"restart"`) | ✅ Confirmed; real container reboot observed |
| 13 | Manage LED on/off | `mgmt_cfg` `led_enabled` | ✅ Confirmed both values live. `led.set_enabled()` uses `trigger=none` + `brightness=1/0`, distinct from the locate blink's timer trigger. |
| 14 | IP Settings (DHCP/Static) | `system_cfg` `netconf.*`/`dhcpc.*`/`route.*` | ✅ Confirmed end-to-end: real kernel interface change, real route, informing from the new address, controller Overview reflecting it back |
| 15 | Power / PoE | `power_source`, `power_source_voltage`, `psu_table`, `power-monitor`, `total_max_power`, `led_state`, `outlet_table` — copied straight off the inform when present | 🔍 Not implemented. The "Power: -" element lives in the **Parent Device** subsection (properties of the upstream LLDP-linked switch), and this environment has no PoE switch. Field names confirmed; values/format not researched, and openUF has no local signal for a real PoE class. |
| 16 | Set Replacement Device / Load Configuration | **None** — controller-side Mongo document clone (`commonDeviceCloneConfigService`), then an ordinary adopt + `setparam` | ✅ Both confirmed live; zero product code needed. Replacement auto-adopts the target ~50 s after the source goes away. |
| 17 | Wired clients | `port_table[]` + per-port `mac_table[]` | ✅ Confirmed live: both fake hosts under Connection → Wired, on the correct port; Ports view renders them |
| 18 | Per-port VLAN assignment | `fw_caps` bit `0x100`; controller pushes `switch.*` | ✅ Confirmed live; verified twice (direct REST and full UI round-trip) |
| 19 | Client block / unblock | `cmd:"block-sta"` / `"unblock-sta"` | ✅ Confirmed live including real nftables enforcement and survival across a simulated reboot. `hostapd_cli` deauth is unit-tested only (no real hostapd here). |
| 20 | Environment / rogue-AP scan | `scan_radio_table[]` | ✅ openUF's payload and the controller's ingestion both confirmed correct (10/10 direct API polls). The tab's own display bug is [controller-side](#controller-side-ui-quirks). |
| 21 | Radios tab + client MIMO/generation | `radio_table` capability fields; per-station `nss`/`is_11*` | ✅ Confirmed live on four stations spanning HT/VHT/HE/legacy |
| 22 | Radios tab Avg. Signal / Interference / Airtime / MIMO | `vap_table.avg_client_signal`; `radio_table.athstats`; `radio_table.radio_caps` | ✅ All four confirmed live on a fresh reset (`-64`/`-50 dBm`, `3%`, `7%`, `2x2`), with bidirectional filter behavior verified |
| 23 | Minimum RSSI | `system_cfg` `stamgr.<n>.*`; outbound `min_rssi`/`min_rssi_enabled` | ✅ Wire format and field names confirmed. Enforcement (`kick_station`) is unit-tested only — no real radios here. |
| 24 | Security tab WPA2/WPA3 protocol options | **None** | ℹ️ Not capability-driven from anything openUF sends. No security-capability field exists in the payload; `ucihelper`'s `SECURITY_MAP` (`wpa2`→`psk2`, `wpa3`→`sae`, `wpa2/wpa3`→`sae-mixed`, `wpa-enterprise`→`wpa2+ccmp`) is a one-way map of a choice the controller has already made. The dropdown's options come from the controller's own internal per-model database, keyed on the reported `model`/`platform`. Not fixable here. |
| 25 | Band Steering / BSS Transition / DTIM | `wireless.<n>.no2ghz_oui` / `aaa.<n>.bss_transition` / `wireless.<n>.dtim_period` | ✅ All three confirmed live by individual before/after `system_cfg` diffs |
| 26 | Show AP Name in Beacon | `wifi_caps2` bit `0x40` → `wireless.<n>.advertise_ap_name` | ✅ Wire protocol and capability gating confirmed live, both directions. **The OpenWrt/hostapd side is not verified** — implemented via the WPS/WSC Device Name attribute (`wps_device_name` + `ap_setup_locked=1`, the standard mechanism, per hostapd's README-WPS/`beacon.c` and OpenWrt's wifi-iface schema) rather than an unknown Ubiquiti vendor IE. Needs real hardware to confirm hostapd accepts it and the beacon changes. |
| 27 | SAE Anti-clogging / Sync Time | `aaa.<n>.sae.anti_clogging` / `.sae.sync` | ⚠️ Key names, integer shape, and `isWpa3()` gating confirmed via an unambiguous decompiled method body. The **emitting** (true WPA3) case could not be live-diffed — forcing pure WPA3 tripped the [config-sync issue](#config-sync-can-get-stuck-after-informs-stabilise). |
| 28 | PMF (802.11w) / Multicast Enhancement | `aaa.<n>.pmf.status`/`.pmf.mode`; `wireless.<n>.mcast.enhance` | ✅ Confirmed live by `system_cfg` diff. PMF is what actually carries WPA2/WPA3 transition intent on this model. |

## Open questions

- **`setdefault` is never dispatched.** Clicking Remove deletes the device server-side and
  flips the UI to "ready to adopt", but no `setdefault` reaches the wire and `state.json` keeps
  `adopted: true` with the old authkey. Whether a real `setdefault` is sent under different
  circumstances (e.g. only over SSH for L2-discovered devices, mirroring how initial adopt
  differs by discovery method) is unconfirmed. openUF's handler is untested but there is no
  evidence it is wrong.
- **`linkscore` and `multicast`** have no known source or reference; currently `0`. Needs a
  live capture from real hardware.
- **`bootrom_version`** has no counterpart in the device schema. Probably ignored.
- **The `spectrum-scan` cmd handler** has never received a real controller-issued command.
- **openUF's `usteer` config option names** are unverified against the real package.
- **hostapd's acceptance of `wps_device_name`/`ap_setup_locked`** needs real hardware.
- **PoE self-reporting** could be reopened if the validation environment ever gains a real
  switch container, or if a non-Parent-Device UI surface for those fields is found.

## Dead ends — do not re-attempt

- **Extracting the AP→controller protocol from U6-InWall firmware.** The official image
  (`v6.8.2+15592`, pulled from `fw-update.ubnt.com`, md5
  `0fec04452cadd2d025777d36ab2974ea`) is a **kernel-only OTA delta**. Its GPT has 5 partitions
  of which only `HLOS` has data; there is no system/rootfs/application partition at all.
  `HLOS.img` is at flat 8.0 bits/byte entropy across ~95% of the file (computed per-1MB block,
  not eyeballed from a binwalk graph), with no compression magic and zero `strings` hits for a
  kernel banner, driver names, or any of `scan`/`spectrum`/`rssi`/`noise`/`channel`/`bssid`.
  Only the last ~1.3 MB is plaintext, and that is device-tree blobs. The inform-client binary
  simply is not in this artifact. Untried alternatives if this ever matters: a pre-2023 build
  that might predate encrypted/kernel-only packaging; pulling the binary off a live owned
  device over SSH; or a LAN packet capture between real hardware and a real controller.
- **Chasing `wait_for_initial_inform` as a thing in itself.** It is downstream of
  [the GCM gate](#the-gcm-provisioning-gate). Editing it in Mongo does nothing (the process
  never re-reads), and restarting the controller to force a reload introduces a separate
  "Offline" artifact.
- **Looking for a manual RF-scan trigger in 10.4.57's UI.** There isn't one — AirView is fed
  entirely by passive, continuously-collected stats. Settings search for "spectrum" returns
  nothing, and no `_type:"cmd"` arrives on its own while the page is open.
- **`strings` on concatenated Java class files on macOS.** `0xCAFEBABE` is both the Java class
  magic and the Mach-O fat-binary magic, so macOS `strings` chokes. Extract printable-ASCII
  runs in Python instead.
- **Deleting a stale wireless client record and waiting for it to reappear.** The pattern works
  for wired clients but wireless ones never came back (45+ s). Recreate the WLAN instead.
