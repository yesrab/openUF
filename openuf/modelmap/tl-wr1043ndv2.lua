	-- Which socket is the uplink is detected at runtime from the switch's ARL
	-- table, not declared -- see sysinfo.uplink_phys_port.
	--
	-- NOT verified against the real board (openUF has never run on one):
	-- dev.conf.vlan.ports below carries the generic template's numbering, and
	-- TP-Link boards commonly put the WAN socket on physical 1 with the LAN
	-- sockets at 2-5, as the Archer C5 turned out to. Check it with
	-- `swconfig dev switch0 show` and the board's stock `network` config
	-- before trusting these labels; a wrong map here mislabels ports (the
	-- uplink is still detected correctly, since that comes from the ARL).
