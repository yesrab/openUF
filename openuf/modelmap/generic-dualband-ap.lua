--[[
	Generic dual-band OpenWrt AP hardware profile.
	Tested with: TP-Link WDR3500.

	Adjust radio names if your device uses different UCI radio identifiers.
	Run `uci show wireless` on the device to confirm interface names.

	A generic profile cannot know a board's LED name or which of its ports is
	the uplink, and the assumptions below (eth0 = WAN uplink, eth1 = a
	downstream LAN port) are wrong on plenty of boards -- an Archer C5 v1
	deployed as an AP uses eth1 as its uplink and never touches eth0, which is
	why it has its own map (modelmap/archer-c5-v1.lua). Prefer a board-specific
	map where one exists, and check these values against your hardware before
	trusting them.

	-- This board exposes only two netdevs (no per-physical-port netdevs),
	-- so the single "lan" entry reports every downstream host behind eth1.
	--
	-- `swport` bridges the two numbering spaces: it names a key in
	-- dev.conf.vlan.ports below (or a physical port number outright), and is
	-- what per-port VLAN assignment (switchvlan.lua) joins on. Without it that
	-- port is skipped rather than guessed at. Uplink ports never get one --
	-- reassigning the uplink's VLAN would strand the device.

	-- know a board's socket layout. A board-specific map should instead list
	-- one entry per physical socket (`{idx = 1, swport = "lan1"}`, ...) with no
	-- `uplink` flag: openUF then reports each socket's own link speed and the
	-- hosts actually behind it, and detects the uplink socket from the
	-- switch's ARL table. See modelmap/archer-c5-v1.lua.
