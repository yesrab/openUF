	"Roaming Assistant": move a weak client to another AP that hears it
	clearly better, and leave it alone when no such AP exists.

	THE WIRE

	Decompiled from controller 10.6.101 (com.ubnt.service.config.ubntconf):
	wireless.<n>.btm_disassoc.status=enabled + .threshold=<dBm>, per WLAN,
	5GHz/6GHz vaps only, emitted only when wifi_caps2 bit 0x20
	(supportsAssistedRoaming) is claimed. The name says what a UniFi AP does
	with it: a BSS Transition Management request, then a disassociation.
	inform.lua parses it; ucihelper stamps the threshold on the wifi-iface as
	openuf_roam_assist; get_vap_table reads it back for build_json, which
	hands this module one observation per associated station per heartbeat.

	WHY NOT usteer's OWN ROAM TRIGGER

	usteer has one (roam_trigger_snr + signal_diff_threshold) and it is
	device-wide: every SSID, every band. Its only scoping knob, ssid_list,
	switches off every usteer function -- band steering included -- for the
	SSIDs it leaves out. The controller setting is per WLAN and per band, so
	the decision is made here, per vap, and usteer is used only for what
	nothing else on the device has: its cross-AP table of which AP heard
	which client how loudly (`ubus call usteer get_client_info`).

	That table carries no timestamps, but usteer expires every entry, local
	and remote, local_sta_timeout (120 s) after the client was last heard
	(usteer sta.c/remote.c). A reading here is therefore at most ~2 minutes
	old. If the client moved in that time the request can name an AP that
	is no longer better; the client then picks for itself after the
	disassociation, which is where a UniFi AP would leave it too.

	WHAT HAPPENS TO A CLIENT

	  1. Its signal stays below the WLAN's threshold for BELOW_HOLD seconds,
	     it has been associated for MIN_CONNECTED seconds, and it was not
	     acted on within COOLDOWN seconds.
	  2. Another AP (a remote usteer node) on the same SSID and the same
	     band hears it at or above the threshold AND at least diff_db
	     better. No such AP: nothing happens, now or later. A genuinely far
	     client is never disconnected by this module.
	  3. A BSS Transition request naming that AP goes out
	     (disassociation_imminent set). 802.11v clients usually roam on it.
	  4. GRACE seconds later, a client still here is disassociated with a
	     short ban (BAN_MS) on this BSS only, so it cannot bounce straight
	     back to the weak AP before trying the strong one. That is the
	     "disassoc" half of btm_disassoc, and it is the only way to move a
	     client without 802.11v at all. The ban is hostapd's own, expires
	     on its own and is not a block: see firewall.lua for that.
