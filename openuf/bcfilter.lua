--[[
	"Multicast and Broadcast Blocker" enforcement (Settings -> WiFi -> [WLAN]).

	The controller pushes this per WLAN as wireless.<n>.bcfilt.status plus a
	bcfilt.<k>.mac allow-list -- see inform.lua's parser for the live wire
	evidence. Unlike every other WLAN setting openUF carries, there is no
	hostapd or OpenWrt option for it: hostapd can suppress group-addressed
	frames wholesale (ap_isolate, disable_dgaf) but has no notion of an
	allow-list, so this is enforced with nftables instead.

	WHAT IT DOES, and why that is deliberately destructive:

	Per Ubiquiti's own documentation this blocks LAN->WLAN multicast and
	broadcast traffic except from the listed source MACs. That genuinely breaks
	DHCP for wireless clients unless the DHCP server's MAC is on the list --
	Ubiquiti documents exactly that, and instructs admins to add it. So the
	filter here is faithful to the controller's intent and deliberately does
	NOT carve out DHCP/ARP exemptions of its own: an admin who enabled this
	control and curated an allow-list would find a silent "helpful" exemption
	harder to debug than the documented behavior.

	The match is on SOURCE MAC in the to-wireless direction: a group-addressed
	frame heading out a managed VAP is dropped unless its sender is
	allow-listed. (Group destinations are not per-station addresses, so a
	destination match could not express an allow-list at all.)

	Mechanism mirrors firewall.lua: a dedicated `bridge` table rebuilt from
	scratch on every reconcile rather than diffed, so it is idempotent and
	self-healing. It uses its OWN table, separate from firewall.lua's `bridge
	openuf` -- that module deletes and recreates its whole table on each
	block/unblock, which would otherwise wipe these rules.

	REQUIRES kmod-nft-bridge. The rule below is the only place openUF uses a
	`meta` expression in the bridge family, and that expression lives in
	nft_meta_bridge.ko -- a module OpenWrt ships in kmod-nft-bridge, which is
	not pulled in by nftables and is absent from a default filogic or ath79
	image (AP2, a JIDU6101 on 25.12.5, did not have it). Without it the kernel
	rejects the rule with a bare "Error: Could not process rule: No such file
	or directory", nft's caret pointing at `oifname`. Everything either side of
	it still succeeds: the table, the chain and the per-VAP allow set are all
	created and populated, so the control looks enabled in the controller and
	on the device while filtering nothing at all. That is why a failed rule
	add warns loudly below rather than being left to the reader of a syslog.
	`ether saddr` needs no module, which is why firewall.lua's block-sta table
	works on the same image and hid this for so long. install.sh and setup.sh
	install the module.

	Upstream verified the ruleset on real hardware (AX3000T, nftables 1.1.6,
	kernel 6.12): with the sender not allow-listed, 14 of 14 broadcast frames
	entering the VLAN bridge from the uplink and heading out the IoT VAP
	matched and were dropped; with the same sender allow-listed, 0 of 15.
