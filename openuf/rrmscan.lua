--[[
	Client-assisted RF environment enrichment (802.11k beacon reports).

	WHY THIS EXISTS

	scan_radio_table (see inform.lua) is built from `iw dev <if> scan dump`,
	the kernel's PASSIVE BSS cache. That cache is filled from beacons the radio
	overhears on the channel it is already serving, so the Environment tab only
	ever shows near-channel neighbours: measured on an AX3000T, 6 BSSes on a
	2.4 GHz radio parked on ch 11, and exactly 1 on a 5 GHz radio on ch 44 --
	its own. openUF will not dwell off-channel behind a client's back to fix
	that; a real off-channel sweep on the same board cost 12% packet loss to an
	associated client for the ~3 s it ran.

	Ubiquiti does not solve this for free either. Their own docs describe three
	paths: a manual "Airtime Scan"/RF Scan that "may interrupt client
	connectivity while in progress", a dedicated Scanning Radio on the models
	that ship a third radio, and Channel AI, which "scans the surrounding
	wireless environment using neighbor reports and automated RRM scans".

	This module implements that last path, and only that one. In an 802.11k
	beacon measurement the CLIENT leaves the channel, scans, and reports what
	it saw; the AP never stops serving. It is the one enrichment that costs the
	AP nothing.

	WHAT IT ACTUALLY BUYS, measured live 2026-09-02

	A single beacon request to one capable client returned 15 BSSes at once,
	across 2.4 GHz channels 1/3/4/6/7/9/10/11 AND 5 GHz channels 36/44/48 --
	from a client associated on a 5 GHz radio. One client's report therefore
	enriches BOTH radios, which is why merge_into() keys on the reported
	channel's band rather than on the interface the request went out of.

	AND WHAT IT DOES NOT

	Support is a client-by-client lottery, so this can only ever supplement the
	passive cache, never replace it. Of 13 real clients surveyed across two
	APs: 9 advertised no 802.11k at all (rrm=0), 3 advertised beacon-active +
	beacon-passive and answered in full, and 1 advertised beacon-table only,
	acknowledged the request at the MAC layer (BEACON-REQ-TX-STATUS ack=1) and
	then never sent a report. Beacon-table alone is therefore NOT treated as
	capable here -- see capable_stations().

	A beacon report also carries less than a scan does: a BSSID, a channel and
	an RCPI, but no SSID, no security and no channel width. Entries that the
	passive cache already knows keep the cache's richer version; entries only
	the client can see are reported with what there is. The controller renders
	a missing WiFi Name as the BSSID, so they are still useful rows.
