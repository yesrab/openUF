--[[
	Per-port VLAN assignment, driven by the controller's `switch.*` push.

	Wire format mapped live 2026-07-19 (see PROTOCOL-VALIDATION.md's `switch.*`
	section) and parsed by inform.lua's M._parse_switch_system_cfg(), which
	hands this module:

	    {enabled = true,
	     vlans = {[1] = {...}, [20] = {...}},
	     ports = {[2] = {pvid = 20, vlans = {[1]="exclude", [20]="untagged"}}}}

	keyed by UniFi port_idx. The controller's untagged|tagged|exclude vocabulary
	maps 1:1 onto swconfig's port membership syntax ("3", "3t", absent).

	=== SCOPE AND LIMITS -- read before extending ===

	**swconfig boards only.** All three boards this project targets (TP-Link
	WDR3500, Archer C5 v1, WR1043ND v2) are ath79/swconfig, and both modelmaps
	already carry the swconfig physical-port map this needs. Modern OpenWrt
	(21.02+) is DSA, where per-port VLAN is `config bridge-vlan` instead --
	detect_backend() recognizes DSA and refuses, rather than emitting
	unverifiable config. There is no DSA board here to verify against.

	**Not verified against real switch hardware.** The validation container has
	no switch, no swconfig binary, and only a mock UCI. What is verified: the
	wire format (live, against a real controller), the parse layer, and the
	UCI state this module produces (unit tests with a mock cursor). What is
	NOT: that the generated `switch_vlan` sections actually program a switch
	ASIC, that traffic lands on the right VLAN, or that the reload command
	behaves on real ath79. Same honesty as bcfilter.lua's nftables caveat.

	**Reversibility.** Assigning a port to a VLAN requires removing it from the
	stock VLAN's port list, so unlike the wireless side this module cannot stay
	entirely inside openuf_-prefixed sections. It therefore snapshots any
	pre-existing section's original `ports` string into openUF's state before
	the first mutation, and restore() puts them back.

	All operations are safe no-ops without dev.conf.vlan (an unknown board's
	switch port map must never be guessed -- that is how you strand a device).

-- Port string trunking one VLAN from the SoC out to the gateway: the CPU port
-- and the uplink socket, both tagged. Nothing else.
--
-- A VLAN-tagged SSID is useless without this. The bridge can be perfect and
-- the VAP up, and the switch still drops every VID it has no entry for once
-- `enable_vlan 1` is set -- which is the stock config on both validated
-- boards. Confirmed live: with the bridge in place and no VLAN 20 entry,
-- pinging the IoT gateway over the tagged interface lost 100% of packets;
-- adding a trunk took it to 0%.
--
-- Those two ports are the whole path: VAP -> br-openuf<id> -> eth0.<id> ->
-- CPU port -> uplink socket -> gateway. A LAN socket is never on it.
--
-- This used to tag EVERY LAN socket, on the reasoning that which one carries
-- the uplink is not knowable and `pvid` is untouched so wired clients see no
-- change. Both halves were wrong, and together they broke every untagged
-- wired host behind an AP running a tagged SSID:
--
--   * The uplink socket IS knowable -- sysinfo.uplink_phys_port() reads it out
--     of the switch's own ARL table, and apply() already has the answer.
--   * On the ar8216/ar8226/ar8229/ar8236 driver family, tagging is NOT per
--     (port, VLAN). ar8xxx_sw_set_ports() folds it into one global per-port
--     bitmask, `priv->vlan_tagged`, and __ar8216_setup_port() picks
--     AR8216_OUT_ADD_VLAN vs AR8216_OUT_STRIP_VLAN from that single bitmask
--     for every VLAN at once. So tagging a socket into VLAN 10 makes it
--     egress-tagged in VLAN 1 too, and the untagged host plugged into it
--     stops receiving. Diagnosed live on a TL-WDR3500 (AR8229): UCI held
--     VLAN 1 as "1 2 3 4 0t" while the switch reported "0t 1t 2t 3t 4t", and
--     a printer on socket 2 was transmitting but deaf.
--
-- The Archer C5's AR8327 has a real per-(port, VLAN) tag table -- ar8327.c
-- overrides the get/set-ports ops -- so it showed none of this, which is
-- exactly why the bug shipped: it is invisible on the board it was written
-- against. Trunking only what the VLAN needs is correct on both, and stops
-- the AR8327 boards making every wired socket a tagged member of the IoT
-- VLAN, which it had no business doing either.
--
-- A consequence worth knowing on the global-bitmask chips: a port cannot be
-- untagged in VLAN 1 and tagged in VLAN 10 at the same time, so running a
-- tagged wireless VLAN necessarily leaves the UPLINK socket egress-tagged for
-- VLAN 1 as well. UniFi gateways accept that (it is the live, working state
-- on the WDR3500), and it is confined to the one port facing the gateway.

-- must hold rather than guess, since guessing wrong here strands the device.
