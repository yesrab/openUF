--[[
	Per-port VLAN assignment, driven by the controller's `switch.*` push.

	Wire format mapped live 2026-07-19 (see PROTOCOL-VALIDATION.md's `switch.*`
	section) and parsed by inform.lua's M._parse_switch_system_cfg(), which
	hands this module:

	    {enabled = true,
	     vlans = {[1] = {...}, [20] = {...}},
	     ports = {[2] = {pvid = 20, vlans = {[1]="exclude", [20]="untagged"}}}}

	keyed by UniFi port_idx. The controller's untagged|tagged|exclude vocabulary
	maps 1:1 onto swconfig's port membership syntax ("3", "3t", absent).

	=== SCOPE AND LIMITS -- read before extending ===

	**Two backends, and they are not equally proven.** The ath79/swconfig boards
	(TP-Link WDR3500, Archer C5 v1, WR1043ND v2) get `switch_vlan` sections and
	need a modelmap physical-port map. Modern OpenWrt (21.02+) is DSA, where
	there is no switch table to write: M.dsa_apply moves the assigned socket out
	of br-lan and into that VLAN's bridge instead. `config bridge-vlan` is
	deliberately NOT used -- see PROTOCOL-VALIDATION.md for the netifd reasons.

	**swconfig is not verified against real switch hardware.** The validation
	container has no switch, no swconfig binary, and only a mock UCI. What is
	verified there: the wire format (live, against a real controller), the parse
	layer, and the UCI state this module produces (unit tests with a mock
	cursor). What is NOT: that the generated `switch_vlan` sections actually
	program a switch ASIC, that traffic lands on the right VLAN, or that the
	reload command behaves on real ath79. Same honesty as bcfilter.lua's
	nftables caveat.

	**DSA is verified on real hardware upstream** -- a Xiaomi AX3000T (mt7530)
	against a real UCG Ultra, including the one-address-table hazard that makes
	`learning '0'` mandatory and the nft tap that gives the reporting back. The
	JioRouter boards' mt7531 is the same driver family, but NONE of the DSA path
	has been exercised on them yet: the drop, the ~140 s convergence and the
	tap are upstream's measurements, not this fork's.

	**Reversibility.** Assigning a port to a VLAN requires removing it from the
	stock VLAN's port list, so unlike the wireless side this module cannot stay
	entirely inside openuf_-prefixed sections. It therefore snapshots any
	pre-existing section's original `ports` string into openUF's state before
	the first mutation, and restore() puts them back.

	All operations are safe no-ops without dev.conf.vlan (an unknown board's
	switch port map must never be guessed -- that is how you strand a device).

-- Port string trunking one VLAN from the SoC out to the gateway: the CPU port
-- and the uplink socket, both tagged. Nothing else.
--
-- A VLAN-tagged SSID is useless without this. The bridge can be perfect and
-- the VAP up, and the switch still drops every VID it has no entry for once
-- `enable_vlan 1` is set -- which is the stock config on both validated
-- boards. Confirmed live: with the bridge in place and no VLAN 20 entry,
-- pinging the IoT gateway over the tagged interface lost 100% of packets;
-- adding a trunk took it to 0%.
--
-- Those two ports are the whole path: VAP -> br-openuf<id> -> eth0.<id> ->
-- CPU port -> uplink socket -> gateway. A LAN socket is never on it.
--
-- This used to tag EVERY LAN socket, on the reasoning that which one carries
-- the uplink is not knowable and `pvid` is untouched so wired clients see no
-- change. Both halves were wrong, and together they broke every untagged
-- wired host behind an AP running a tagged SSID:
--
--   * The uplink socket IS knowable -- sysinfo.uplink_phys_port() reads it out
--     of the switch's own ARL table, and apply() already has the answer.
--   * On the ar8216/ar8226/ar8229/ar8236 driver family, tagging is NOT per
--     (port, VLAN). ar8xxx_sw_set_ports() folds it into one global per-port
--     bitmask, `priv->vlan_tagged`, and __ar8216_setup_port() picks
--     AR8216_OUT_ADD_VLAN vs AR8216_OUT_STRIP_VLAN from that single bitmask
--     for every VLAN at once. So tagging a socket into VLAN 10 makes it
--     egress-tagged in VLAN 1 too, and the untagged host plugged into it
--     stops receiving. Diagnosed live on a TL-WDR3500 (AR8229): UCI held
--     VLAN 1 as "1 2 3 4 0t" while the switch reported "0t 1t 2t 3t 4t", and
--     a printer on socket 2 was transmitting but deaf.
--
-- The Archer C5's AR8327 has a real per-(port, VLAN) tag table -- ar8327.c
-- overrides the get/set-ports ops -- so it showed none of this, which is
-- exactly why the bug shipped: it is invisible on the board it was written
-- against. Trunking only what the VLAN needs is correct on both, and stops
-- the AR8327 boards making every wired socket a tagged member of the IoT
-- VLAN, which it had no business doing either.
--
-- A consequence worth knowing on the global-bitmask chips: a port cannot be
-- untagged in VLAN 1 and tagged in VLAN 10 at the same time, so running a
-- tagged wireless VLAN necessarily leaves the UPLINK socket egress-tagged for
-- VLAN 1 as well. UniFi gateways accept that (it is the live, working state
-- on the WDR3500), and it is confined to the one port facing the gateway.

-- must hold rather than guess, since guessing wrong here strands the device.

-- === DSA: per-port VLAN without touching br-lan ============================
--
-- Adopted from upstream (jonasevcik/openUF, verified on a Xiaomi AX3000T's
-- mt7530); the JioRouter boards' mt7531 is the same driver family.
--
-- The swconfig path above programs a switch ASIC's VLAN table. DSA has no such
-- table to write and no `swconfig` to write it with, and the obvious
-- translation -- `config bridge-vlan` sections plus vlan_filtering on br-lan --
-- is the wrong answer here twice over:
--
--   1. br-lan carries the AP's own management address and the uplink socket.
--      Turning vlan_filtering on there means every VLAN, the management one
--      included, must be declared exactly right or the device is stranded at
--      the far end of a cable with no way back. That is the single most
--      dangerous thing this module could do.
--   2. It would silently fight the tagged-SSID path. `wan.10` is an 8021q
--      device on the `wan` BRIDGE PORT, and vlan_do_receive() runs ahead of
--      the bridge's rx_handler in __netif_receive_skb_core -- so VLAN 10
--      frames are claimed by wan.10 before br-lan ever sees them. A
--      bridge-vlan declaring VLAN 10 on br-lan would therefore never receive
--      anything, while looking perfectly correct in UCI.
--
-- What DSA wants instead is the L2 openUF already builds for a tagged SSID.
-- Assigning a socket to VLAN 10 means moving it out of br-lan and into
-- br-openuf10 -- the bridge that already holds the tagged uplink sub-device.
-- Then:
--
--     device on lan3 --untagged--> lan3 -> br-openuf10 -> <uplink>.10 --tagged--> uplink
--
-- and the return path is the same in reverse. br-lan keeps the uplink, the
-- unassigned sockets and the management address, entirely untouched; nothing
-- anywhere runs with vlan_filtering. A wired device and a wireless client on
-- the same VLAN land in the same bridge, which is not a coincidence but the
-- point -- they are one broadcast domain and the controller models them as
-- one network.
--
-- OWNERSHIP of br-openuf<vid>: ucihelper.ensure_vlan_network guarantees the
-- tagged uplink is a member and never removes anyone else; this module owns
-- the socket members. Neither touches the other's.

	-- Measured on an AX3000T (2026-09-12) with an IKEA Trådfri hub on port 2,

-- === Getting the hosts back that `learning '0'` took away ==================
--
-- dsa_apply has to turn MAC learning off on every socket it moves into a VLAN
-- bridge, or the ASIC hardware-drops the replies (the measurement is in the
-- comment above). The bill for that arrives in the inform payload: the socket's
-- hosts vanish from `bridge fdb`, port_table publishes an empty mac_table, and
-- the controller credits the client to whoever else saw the MAC -- the gateway,
-- which sees everything. Seen in production: a wired IoT device on an assigned
-- socket listed under the gateway at the gateway's link speed.
--
-- There is no way to keep the software half of learning and drop the hardware
-- half. One BR_LEARNING flag per bridge port, mirrored into the driver by DSA;
-- the ASIC entry cannot be deleted (ENOENT) or flushed (EOPNOTSUPP) and is
-- re-learned on the client's next frame anyway. The switch-level fix is to make
-- the switch VLAN-aware (`vlan_filtering` + `config bridge-vlan`), which would
-- restore learning AND hardware offload -- PROTOCOL-VALIDATION.md records why
-- that is not what this does.
--
-- So openUF observes the socket somewhere the FDB is not: a bridge-family
-- prerouting rule that files each frame's source address into a dynamic set.
-- The socket is in a bridge whose other member is a software device, so it
-- cannot be hardware-offloaded and every one of its frames reaches the CPU --
-- which is the same fact that makes this tap see everything the FDB used to.
--
-- Two sets, one rule each, covering every tapped socket at once; a flat element
-- list beats one set per socket to parse, and sysinfo reads both in a single
-- `nft list table`. The 5m timeouts mirror the bridge's own FDB ageing so an
-- unplugged client expires the way it used to.
--
--   portmacs  ifname . ether_addr                WHO is behind the socket.
--   portips   ifname . ether_addr . ipv4_addr    and WHICH ADDRESS they have.
--
-- portips is not a nicety. The controller classifies a wired client into a
-- network by the IP the reporting device puts in `mac_table[].ip`, NOT by the
-- port's native VLAN -- verified against a live UCG Ultra, where every wired
-- client carrying a reported IP landed in that IP's subnet and the one without
-- fell back to the reporting AP's own network. An assigned socket is on a VLAN
-- the AP holds no address on, so /proc/net/arp can never answer for it and the
-- IP would be absent: the port would be right and the network label wrong.
--
-- Sources are ARP and IPv4 alike, because either one identifies the sender and
-- a device that only ever ARPs still has to be reported. 0.0.0.0 is excluded on
-- both: a DHCP DISCOVER and an ARP probe both carry it, and neither is an
-- address the host actually holds.
