	openUF main configuration.

	Select the modelmap that matches your hardware (see openuf/modelmap/).
	Known-working modelmap files:
	  generic-dualband-ap.lua — TP-Link WDR3500, Archer C5 v1 (dual-band)
	  tl-wr1043ndv2.lua       — TP-Link WR1043ND v2 (single-band)

	The modelmap drives:
	  • dev.conf.net.*          network interface assignments
	  • dev.openuf.uap.ufmodel  which ufmodel/* to load (e.g. "u6iw")
	  • dev.openuf.uap.hwassign radio names to include in the inform payload

	The ufmodel controls the device identity presented to the controller:
	  u6iw.lua  — presents as U6-InWall (U6IW)  ← default for AP emulation
	  uapg1.lua — presents as UAP Gen1
	  uapg2-ac-lr.lua — presents as UAP-AC-LR

	openUF emulates a UniFi AP only. Gateway (USG) and switch (USW) emulation
	are not implemented and are not planned.
