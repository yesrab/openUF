--[[
	Client blocking, driven by the controller's "Block"/"Unblock" client
	actions. Delivered as a one-shot inform-response cmd (`{"_type":"cmd",
	"cmd":"block-sta"|"unblock-sta","mac":"<mac>"}`) -- confirmed live against
	a real controller (see PROTOCOL-VALIDATION.md). There is no persistent
	wire-level block list the controller pushes on every inform (a candidate
	top-level `include_blocks` field stays empty even while a client is
	blocked) -- the device is expected to remember the block itself, the same
	way real hardware persists it locally after a one-shot command.

	Enforcement is nftables, in a dedicated `bridge openuf` table so it never
	collides with (or gets wiped by) OpenWrt's own fw4-managed tables. Rules
	are added directly to the live kernel ruleset, not via UCI -- like
	netconfig.lua's `ip addr`/`ip route` calls, this is ephemeral runtime
	state that must be explicitly reconciled again after a restart (see
	M.reconcile, called both on the block/unblock cmd and at inform.lua
	startup with the persisted list from state.json).

	A single dynamic nft set (`blocked_macs`) holds every blocked MAC, with
	two static rules matching against it (source and destination) -- adding/
	removing a MAC is then a single `nft add|delete element` against the set,
	never touching the rules themselves. M.reconcile rebuilds the whole table
	from scratch (delete + recreate) rather than diffing, mirroring
	netconfig.lua's flush-then-reapply pattern -- simpler and self-healing if
	the table was ever left in an unexpected state.
