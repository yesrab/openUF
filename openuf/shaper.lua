	"WiFi Speed Limit" enforcement (Settings -> WiFi -> [WLAN]).

	The controller pushes this per VAP as qos.vap.<m>.dwnlink.maxspeed /
	uplink.1.maxspeed, in kbps, keyed by devname -- see inform.lua's parser for
	the live wire evidence and for why the presence of *maxspeed* (rather than
	of the block, or of the global qos.status) is what marks a VAP as limited.

	Note the control only becomes assignable once a speed-limit *profile*
	exists in the site settings; with no profile the per-WLAN toggle has
	nothing to select and nothing reaches the wire.

	Neither hostapd nor OpenWrt's wifi-iface schema has any notion of a
	throughput cap, so this is enforced with tc, the same way bcfilter.lua
	reaches for nftables.

	WHAT IT DOES:

	The cap is a per-VAP aggregate, not per-client -- it applies to the netdev
	as a whole, so all clients on that SSID share the ceiling. That is what the
	wire describes (one maxspeed per vap devname, no per-station structure) and
	it is why one qdisc per VAP is sufficient.

	  * Downlink (AP -> clients) is egress on the VAP netdev: an HTB root qdisc
	    with a single rate-capped default class.
	  * Uplink (clients -> LAN) is ingress on the VAP netdev: an ingress qdisc
	    with a match-everything u32 filter carrying a police action. Ingress
	    cannot be queued, only policed, so excess traffic is dropped rather
	    than delayed -- TCP backs off, which is the standard mechanism.

	The stock firmware would instead replay the qos.ebt.<n>.cmd ebtables
	fragments that fwmark each VAP; openUF implements the intent directly on
	the netdev, since ebtables is not a given on OpenWrt while tc is part of
	the base iproute2.

	Mechanism mirrors bcfilter.lua/firewall.lua: rebuilt from scratch on every
	reconcile rather than diffed, so it is idempotent and self-healing, and an
	empty rule list tears down any previous shaping.

	Every command emitted here was checked against real tc (iproute2 6.9.0) on
	a dummy netdev before being committed -- including the explicit `quantum`,
	without which HTB warns "quantum of class ... is big. Consider r2q change."
	NOT verified against real hardware or real radios: what is confirmed is the
	wire format and that the generated commands are accepted by tc, not the
	on-air throughput they produce.
