# openUF bootstrap adoption shell.
#
# Forced login shell for the temporary --bootstrap-adopt account (see
# install.sh). Permits exactly one command shape and nothing else, whether
# invoked interactively or non-interactively over SSH:
#
#   syswrapper.sh set-adopt <url> <key32hex>
#
# Any other input -- including a plain interactive login attempt -- is
# refused. This is the actual security boundary for the bootstrap account:
# it holds no elevated privilege of its own (see install.sh's
# --bootstrap-adopt, which makes it a non-root user only able to write
# /etc/openuf), but this restriction means it can never be used for
# anything beyond the one adoption call regardless of that.
