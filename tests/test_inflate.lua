-- Tests for openuf/inflate.lua (pure-Lua DEFLATE / zlib).
-- Run from project root: lua tests/run_tests.lua
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--
-- This is not a fallback path. inform.lua prefers a native `zlib` binding and
-- falls back to this module -- but OpenWrt 25.12 ships no Lua zlib binding, so
-- on every real target the fallback IS the path: every FLAG_COMPRESSED
-- response from the controller is decompressed by the code under test here. A
-- bug in it fails the inform outright, and until now 225 lines of hand-written
-- bitstream reader, Huffman table builder and dynamic-table decoder had no
-- test of any kind.
--
-- The three DEFLATE block types are all exercised, because they share almost
-- no code: stored (btype 0) bypasses Huffman entirely, fixed (btype 1) uses
-- the RFC's built-in tables, and dynamic (btype 2) has to decode the
-- code-length alphabet first -- by far the most intricate part of the module.
--
-- Fixtures are real zlib output, kept as hex so they stay reviewable in a
-- diff. Regenerate with:
--   python3 -c 'import zlib; print(zlib.compress(b"...", 9).hex())'
-- The block type of a stream is bits 1-2 of its first DEFLATE byte, i.e.
-- (byte(data, 3) >> 1) % 4 counting the two-byte zlib header.

local inflate = dofile("openuf/inflate.lua")

-- Hex string -> binary. Fixtures are hex so a byte-level diff is readable.
